    n was found, and the "Collided meshes" output to a list of meshes involved in the collision.

In the context of motion planning libraries, this Grasshopper component can be seen as a simple way to check for collisions between multiple objects (robot links, obstacles, or environment) in a 3D environment. It is not a full-fledged motion planning algorithm like those found in libraries like MoveIt, ROS, or OMPL. Instead, it serves as a basic building block to create custom collision checking solutions within the Grasshopper environment.

If you want to integrate this component with a more advanced motion pl
